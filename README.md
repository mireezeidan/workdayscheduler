This is the link to my webpage and repo.

## Purpose

The purpose of this webpage is to create a scheduler that allows you to enter and save TODO's for the day based on the hour. Each hours color indicates whether the time is in the past, present, or future.

## My Experience

My experience creating this webpage was interesting, I was tested with adding and removing the colors along with the challenge of saving what the user inputs. Overall, this homework was very helpful to understanding how to save items as well as adding and removing classes in JavaScript.
